has put on hold its planned crude oil capacity increase and will now focus on expanding natural gas liquids and condensates, which aligns with its efforts to boost domestic gas supply.", "8": "It may also reflect an acknowledgment of the rapidly building surplus in global crude oil production capacity.", "9": "The rise of petrochemicals as the main pillar of global demand growth largely tracks the substantial increase in global supply of NGLs, which are instrumental in their production.", "10": "At the same time, these changes will also create new challenges for refiners as demand for refined products is displaced by non refined products such as NGLs and biofuels.", "11": "Non refined fuels are set to capture a staggering three quarters of projected global demand growth over the 2023 2030 period.", "12": "Moreover, refiners will need to reconfigure their product slates to meet divergent trends for distillates amid reduced consumption as the energy transition accelerates.", "13": "This is especially the case in road transport fuels as EVs rapidly increase their market share.", "14": "Amid all these structural changes to supply and demand patterns, the global oil market outlook faces further uncertainties from weaker macroeconomic expectations, new government policies and regulations to fast track the energy transition, and an unprecedented level of investment to scale up more efficient technologies.", "15": "While the challenges are formidable, the industry has consistently proved its adaptability to dramatic supply and demand changes, including from the energy crisis brought on by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the Covid 19 pandemic before that.", "16": "A ramping up of world oil production capacity, led by the United States and other producers in the

post Covid economic  rebound.", "76": "These campaigns can be considered largely successful in that consumer inflation, although still above target, has eased considerably, while economic activity remained mostly robust.", "77": "Still, the long term impact of this bout of monetary tightening is undetermined, especially in developed countries.", "78": "Here, GDP growth remains subpar at 1 to 2% over the forecast period amid lacklustre manufacturing and trade, and tight credit conditions.", "79": "On a global level, this is partly counterbalanced by robust growth in non OECD economies, averaging 4% in India and other Asian countries.", "80": "While China\u2019s growth will also settle around this level, this marks a sharp deceleration from the country\u2019s overleveraged 1990 2010

average annual rate of 3% over the forecasting period.", "82": "Now that the pandemic period  has concluded", "83": ", economic fundamentals are set to regain their traditional role as main drivers of oil demand, albeit only briefly.", "84": "Global oil demand growth of about 1 mb/d in 2024 and 2025 is roughly in line with the level implied by GDP growth.", "85": "However, this long established correlation is set to break down in subsequent years.", "86": "Oil consumption effectively decouples from GDP from 2026 onwards, as substitution away from oil in transport and power generation pushes oil demand growth towards zero, and eventually into decline.", "87": "The substitution effect is especially prominent in transport , the mainstay of oil demand , with road fuel demand already plateauing this year, and total transport close behind.", "88": "EV sales are set to continue their stellar growth trajectory, resulting in significant fuel savings.", "89": "This will displace 6 mb/d of gasoline and diesel demand by 2030, with a further contribution from improving fuel economies.", "90": "Post pandemic changes in consumer mobility behaviour contribute a further 1 mb/d in transport fuel savings as remote and hybrid work are now well established.", "91": "The picture for public transport use is more mixed , city mass transit ridership has not yet regained 2019 levels in developed countries, partly because consumers shifted to car journeys.", "92": "Conversely, in China public transport rebounded to pre Covid levels in the immediate aftermath of the country\u2019s reopening, while highway passenger volumes remain at around half of 2019 levels, according to data reported by China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics .", "93": "The displacement of oil used in electricity generation will also play a major role in shifting global demand to a plateau.", "94": "In particular, Saudi Arabia has plans that would see about 1 mb/d cut from direct crude, fuel oil and gasoil use in power plants by 2030.", "95": "A large increase in utilisation of domestic gas and renewable resources would enable this.", "96": "Iraq is also expected to reduce oil burn in power plants, albeit on a smaller scale.", "97": "Long distance transport such as aviation and marine shipping, where demand is less amenable to direct substitution, will continue to post growth.", "98": "However, here

2019 levels.", "100": "Consumption is not expected to surpass pre Covid levels until 2027, with healthy underlying demand for air travel counterbalanced by major strides in aircraft fuel efficiencies.", "101": "Along the same line, efficiencies related to regulations by the International Maritime Organization  are set to gradually erode consumption of marine fuels.", "102": "In a marked contrast to the increasingly anaemic gains in transport fuels, petrochemical feedstocks will be the cornerstones of overall growth, as global polymer and synthetic fibre consumption steadily rises.", "103": "Naphtha and LPG/ethane use will climb by a combined 3,7 mb/d over the forecast period.", "104": "Four fifths of this increment will be for deliveries to petrochemical plants, with growth in LPG demand for clean cooking and other domestic applications also playing a major role.", "105": "Especially strong growth for LPG/ethane use , up by 2,5 mb/d between 2023 and 2030 , reflects substantial increases in new NGL supply, notably from the United States and major Middle Eastern producers.", "106": "China will continue to dominate growth in petrochemicals and gains of 1,4 mb/d in feedstock products will be close to the country\u2019s overall increase to 2030.", "107": "On the other hand, rapid deployment of clean energy technologies will balance strong underlying mobility growth.", "108": "Climbing EV sales and the impacts of infrastructure investments such as high speed rail have blunted gasoline demand growth and China\u2019s use of the fuel is set to peak by 2025.", "109": "In India transport fuels will defy the global trend and increase significantly.", "110": "Indian demand is expected to rise by 1,3 mb/d, with growth almost equal to that of its northern neighbour.", "111": "Combined gains in all non OECD Asian economies other than China and India will be even larger at 1,6 mb/d.", "112": "Together, emerging Asian economies will be far and away the most important source of oil demand growth this decade.", "113": "2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2023 30", "114": "By contrast, demand in OECD economies will continue its decades long decline.", "115": "In 2007, OECD demand was 50,2 mb/d and accounted for 57% of global oil use.", "116": "By 2019 this had fallen to 47,5 mb/d  and in 2023 deliveries averaged 45,7 mb/d .", "117": "By 2030, OECD consumption will drop to 42,7 mb/d, 41% of the global total.", "118": "Advanced economies have comparatively low GDP elasticities and can expect more limited economic growth.", "119": "In general, they have also implemented ambitious clean energy policies.", "120": "As a result, OECD countries will experience the largest declines in transport fuel demand and smaller rises in jet fuel demand.", "121": "Increases in OECD petrochemical feedstock use will be largely confined to the United States.", "122": "There are various risks to our demand forecast, of which assumptions about economic growth, oil prices and the pace of EV sales are key.", "123": "Also, deviations for these factors are likely to be interdependent , for example, a faster pace of GDP growth is likely to be accompanied by higher oil prices and quicker EV adoption.", "124": "Moreover, oil\u2019s flattish, plateauing demand profile post 2027 means that it would only take relatively minor changes in its underlying drivers to directionally shift oil\u2019s demand trajectory.", "125": "For example, either a 0,3% quickening in global GDP growth, a USD 5/bbl annual decline in real oil prices or a 15% slowdown in the pace of global EV adoption would be sufficient for oil consumption to cross the narrow dividing line back from shrinkage to growth at the end of the decade.", "126": "Conversely, opposite shifts of the same magnitude would accelerate oil demand\u2019s slide into contraction.", "127": "The global economy is still in the process of adjusting to 2022\u2019s sea change, when major central banks launched their unprecedented battle against consumer inflation that reached 40 year highs.", "128": "These measures have to date resulted in a cumulative 4 5% hike in interest rates for advanced economies.", "129": "Whilst still inconclusive considering monetary policy\u2019s long and variable lags, these campaigns can so far be considered largely successful, inflation has retreated from its 9 10% peak to around 3% in most developed countries.", "130": "Moreover, the decline has been achieved without driving the global economy into recession, amid notably firm labour markets and resilient consumer spending.", "131": "However, the final stage of this push has proved challenging, with inflation remaining stubbornly above its target of 2%, by around 1 2%.", "132": "Until this \u201clast mile\u201d has been completed, the hoped for soft landing for the global economy, accompanied by a return to monetary easing, may prove elusive.", "133": "In this context, breakeven inflation rates derived from bond markets price annual US inflation at around 2,4% at a five year horizon.", "134": "Regardless, higher interest rates and tighter credit mean that global economic growth is set to remain below its pre pandemic trend for the foreseeable future.", "135": "A slump in global trade weighs heavily on export dependent China and the eurozone, with both pivoting towards structurally lower expansion.", "136": "In this regard, the present shift towards deglobalisation does not augur well, as higher tariffs and other restrictions hamper trade and upend supply chains.", "137": "Sino US trade frictions, focused on technology, have become especially visible.", "138": "In parallel, geopolitical risks have also become more pertinent, amid wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and an increasingly tense relationship between China and some neighbouring countries.", "139": "Government spending has been rampant since the pandemic, with knock on effects on borrowing, interest rates and prices.", "140": "As outlays for programmes such as social security, health care, the green economy and defence balloon, so do fiscal

OECD GDP growth more than double the OECD rate .", "144": "By 2030, the non OECD share of total global GDP will climb to 59%, from 55% in 2023.", "145": "GDP expansion in the United States will reach 2,6% in 2024 before subsiding, as higher for longer interest rates trickle down into the real economy and excess savings from the pandemic era are finally depleted.", "146": "Growth will average 1,7% over the remainder of the forecast period.", "147": "Soaring fiscal deficits  will increasingly add to price pressures and act as a drag on economic growth.", "148": "The eurozone will gradually emerge from the economic stagnation that began in 2022, as lower interest rates and disinflation boost real incomes and private consumption.", "149": "Germany will be a key engine of the modest recovery as a rebound in manufacturing lifts GDP growth to 1,3% in 2025 after two years of little growth and will remain around that level thereafter.", "150": "Japan\u2019s GDP will expand by 0,5% on average between 2024 and 2030, the lowest of any major economy as an ageing population and a shrinking labour force weigh on productivity and depress potential growth.", "151": "China\u2019s economy

deflationary spiral amid soft domestic demand.", "152": "Baseline trend growth will fall below 4% in 2026 and remain there to the end of our forecast period.", "153": "Whilst reasonably firm in global terms, this is around half of the country\u2019s pre pandemic trend.", "154": "India\u2019s GDP growth will remain by far the strongest among major economies, averaging 6,5% over the forecast period due to structural tailwinds such as benign demographics, a burgeoning middle class, and accelerating urbanisation and industrialisation.", "155": "Oil demand will grow at a relatively fast rate as the energy intensity of the country\u2019s economy picks up from a low base.", "156": "Assumptions about GDP growth and its impact on oil demand are a key component of our demand estimates.", "157": "The average GDP elasticity of global oil demand is about 0,3 for OECD and 0,6 for non OECD, reflecting the greater oil intensity of emerging markets.", "158": "Additionally, expectations of future oil prices are paramount for demand estimates, with forecasts sensitive to both the absolute price level and sequential price changes over the outlook period.", "159": "Oil prices used for the modelling are based on an average 2025 Brent crude price of about USD 79/bbl , which is held constant in real terms over the remainder of the forecasting period.", "160": "In addition to this base case, we have considered alternative high and low price Scenarios.", "161": "Assumes oil prices increase by 2,5% in real terms per annum, in line with their long term historical pattern.", "162": "Estimates of future spot prices are based on the ICE Brent forward curve .", "163": "These prices are then discounted to real terms.", "164": "The high price scenario would curtail 2030 global oil demand by 650 kb/d.", "165": "However, this would not cause demand to peak earlier.", "166": "Conversely, the low price scenario would lift oil consumption by 1,1 mb/d at the end of the forecasting period, eliminating the current 2029 peak.", "167": "The impact of changes in oil prices on oil demand is roughly similar in OECD and non OECD economies, despite non OECD oil consumption being, at least in theory, more sensitive to changes in oil prices.", "168": "Developing economies tend to be more oil intensive with their output gravitating towards agriculture and heavy industry.", "169": "Also, energy ranks high in developing country Consumer Price Index  baskets, with poorer households spending a larger share of their income on basic goods.", "170": "In theory, this results in higher oil demand price elasticities, as a price increase will be more keenly felt in developing countries.", "171": "However, these higher theoretical elasticities for lower income countries are not at all clear in reality.", "172": "This is because the market price mechanism whereby open market oil prices are converted into retail prices is less straightforward in poorer countries, being heavily mediated by their governments through price controls and subsidies.", "173": "These controls contribute to retail prices that are, as a rule, much lower in developing countries and closer to global wholesale market levels.", "174": "In this regard, poorer countries contrast sharply with OECD countries where elevated fuel taxes inflate retail prices.", "175": "More importantly, the prevalence of price controls in non OECD economies results in a weak pass through of market oil prices into pump prices.", "176": "A prime example is India, where retail prices have remained virtually unchanged since mid 2022.", "177": "Retail pump prices in petrostates such as Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Kuwait and Qatar have also been fixed for years, according to data from GlobalPetrolPrices.", "178": "Statistically, the disparity is reflected in the demand weighted correlation between global gasoline prices and local currency retail pump prices.", "179": "From January 2021 to February 2024, this

continue to display stellar growth.", "182": "According to the IEA\u2019s Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2024, sales could reach around 17 million in 2024, increasing from 14 million in 2023, with EVs accounting for nearly one in five cars sold globally.", "183": "This ascent is set to persist, with total sales projected to reach 40 million in 2030, when almost one in two new cars will be an EV.", "184": "This will displace around 6 mb/d of road fuels demand by the end of our forecast period.", "185": "The EV phenomenon remains primarily a Chinese one.", "186": "In 2023 the majority of EV sales were in China , with Europe  and the United States  accounting for the bulk of sales elsewhere.", "187": "This dominance is set to continue , almost one in three cars on the roads in China by 2030 is expected to be electric, compared to almost one in five in both the United States and the European Union.", "188": "Along the same lines, more than half of all EVs sold globally were produced by Chinese carmakers, compared to only 10% for internal combustion engine  cars.", "189": "The environment for EVs has become more challenging in Western countries of late amid the partial phasing out of tax breaks and subsidies, with unsold cars piling up at car dealership lots.", "190": "In contrast to China\u2019s mass market adoption, EVs remain a comparatively niche product in developed economies, experiencing difficulty broadening their appeal beyond relatively prosperous, environmentally concerned urban motorists.", "191": "High sticker prices, the lack of an adequate charging infrastructure and collapsing second hand values act as deterrents to less affluent buyers.", "192": "At the same time, trade frictions between China and the west are building due to cheap EVs from China rapidly gaining market share, crowding out higher cost Western carmakers.", "193": "This has prompted accusations that, backed by disproportionate government aid, China is exporting its structural overcapacity.", "194": "The May 2024 decision by the Biden Administration to quadruple tariffs on Chinese EVs is a case in point.", "195": "The European Union was also conducting an anti dumping investigation into Chinese EVs at the time of writing.", "196": "Despite these headwinds, we expect EV growth to continue the acceleration of recent years, with oil demand savings advancing as more cars enter the fleet.", "197": "This increase will be underpinned by ambitious zero emissions targets, ongoing industrial policy support and steadily falling prices , parity with ICE cars could be attained by 2030 for most models outside of China.", "198": "Still, it is worth emphasising that our forecast is highly dependent on EV ownership extending beyond early adopters and finding mass market acceptance in Western economies.", "199": "While China remains the key driver of growth, sales will become less concentrated both geographically  and in terms of fuels, with diesel gaining in relative importance.", "200": "EVs are set to avoid an extra annual 1 mb/d of road fuels demand in 2029 and 2030, for a cumulative displacement of 6,1 mb/d, marking a sixfold increase versus 2023.", "201": "Of this amount, 4,7 mb/d will be in gasoline and 1,4 mb/d in diesel.", "202": "For the latter fuel, commercial and freight use will account for around 1 mb/d of savings, while in regional terms Europe will be responsible for the lion\u2019s share at 630 kb/d, outstripping the continent\u2019s gasoline savings of 530 kb/d.", "203": "Efficiency improvements will assume increased importance over the forecast period in all transport segments, including road, maritime and aviation.", "204": "Total efficiency gains are expected to reduce oil demand growth by 4,7 mb/d from 2023 to

tailpipe emissions amid a \u201ctechnology neutral\u201d approach.", "208": "Besides fully electric vehicles, compliance can be attained by producing a range of \u201ccleaner\u201d cars, including gas powered cars, hybrid EVs, and plug in hybrids.", "209": "Much of these efficiency gains are being offset by a shift towards larger conventional cars, which will support road fuel demand in the medium term.", "210": "To a considerable extent, improvements in engine efficiency have enabled more widespread ownership of larger vehicles, as fuel cost savings increase affordability, in line with the

"Imports of paraxylene, the most important aromatic building block molecule, have collapsed by almost 40%.", "332": "Overall, we estimate that increased Chinese production has displaced more than 700 kb/d of feedstock demand in the rest of the world, so that more than one third of the rise in Chinese feedstock requirements has been at the expense of oil consumption in other regions.", "333": "US output of petrochemicals has also risen dramatically as a result of burgeoning domestic NGL supply and investments in capacity to utilise the resulting low cost ethane on a large scale.", "334": "Total US ethane demand was 2,1 mb/d in 2023, 560 kb/d higher than in 2019 and almost double its 2015 level.", "335": "This growth has been overwhelmingly to produce polyethylene and ethylene glycol for export.", "336": "Total US exports of ethylene derivatives have increased by 33% since 2019, according to ICIS data.", "337": "These volumes would require 300 kb/d of ethane to produce.", "338": "Further growth will be comparatively limited to 2030, with the start up of only one more world scale ethane cracker expected, in 2027 or 2028.", "339": "Nonetheless, ample domestic availability

exclusively in Korea and Japan, fell by 7,9%  between 2021 and 2023.", "347": "We estimate that naphtha use in the rest of Asia declined by 16% , with drops concentrated in Chinese Taipei and Thailand.", "348": "Activity at other chemical industry hubs, notably Singapore also likely suffered significantly.", "349": "As with Europe, we have assumed that there will not be a sharp rebound in activity during the medium term, owing to continued competitive pressures.", "350": "At first glance, the fact that Asian feedstock demand fell by less than in Europe is a little surprising.", "351": "Asian petrochemical operations are much more directly exposed to Chinese competition than their peers elsewhere and operate on a similar cost base to Europe.", "352": "Multiple factors have likely contributed to this comparative resilience.", "353": "Typically, plants in the region are newer and better integrated to refineries and downstream consumption , especially in Korea, which accounted for 40% of 2023 Asian naphtha demand .", "354": "Notably, European capacities are often operated by companies with global portfolios of plants.", "355": "In an oversupplied global market, this may result in these producers deciding to supply European customers by bringing in additional material from lower cost regions like North America.", "356": "Middle Eastern producers, especially in Saudi Arabia and Iran, also appear to have lost substantial market share over recent years.", "357": "While regional producers should be highly cost competitive, a decline in operating rates may reflect limitations on feedstock availability amid upstream production cuts and a strong focus on export markets in general, and China in particular.", "358": "Saudi 2023 exports of ethylene derivatives fell by 21% compared with 2019, according to ICIS data.", "359": "Although partially offset by rising domestic demand, this would be equivalent to a combined loss of 230 kb/d in LPG and ethane use.", "360": "In Iran, which is extremely dependent on China as a polymer export destination, ethylene exports fell by 35%, or the equivalent of 70 kb/d of LPG/ethane demand over the same period.", "361": "Nevertheless, we expect Middle Eastern petrochemical operations to recover and post strong growth during the decade.", "362": "An expected 270 kb/d of ethane will come from Saudi Aramco\u2019s NGL rich Jafurah project.", "363": "Along with a similar volume of LPG, this would be sufficient to reinforce operating rates at existing facilities and supply new steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation  units, while making additional LPG volumes available for export.", "364": "Other new plants in the UAE, Qatar and Oman will also add to regional demand for naphtha, LPG and ethane consumption for an overall increase in 2030 feedstock use of 520 kb/d compared with 2023.", "365": "Chinese petrochemical feedstocks have provided the single most important contribution to world oil demand growth in recent years, dovetailing neatly with one of the largest driver of incremental global supply: US NGLs.", "366": "Together these countries have formed a mutually reinforcing symbiosis, with the wave of cheap propane and ethane exports from the United States finding an indispensable outlet and keeping input costs for Chinese importers low.", "367": "This has transformed oil and petrochemical market dynamics.", "368": "Between 2019 and 2023, US exports of ethane and LPG increased by 940 kb/d, according to Kpler data.", "369": "A large majority of these incremental volumes went to China, where US shipments rose from close to zero, to around 700 kb/d.", "370": "Total Chinese imports of these products increased by only 570 kb/d over the period.", "371": "During this period, the United States has also been the only major producer to boost its polymer exports into China, according to ICIS data.", "372": "Total North American shipments more than doubled from 2019 to 2023, corresponding to 160 kb/d of ethane use.", "373": "By this combination, China has accommodated an equivalent of about 850 kb/d of burgeoning US NGL supply since 2019.", "374": "This is just over half of global demand growth across all oil products over the same period.", "375": "Alongside this regional interdependence, a similar relationship exists between ethane crackers, which produce ethylene, and PDH units, which produce propylene from propane.", "376": "Together, these can replace the two most important outputs of naphtha crackers, which produce significant amounts of both major light olefins.", "377": "In the past, the impact of increases in ethane cracker capacity on naphtha cracking was limited by their lack of propylene production.", "378": "New ethane consuming units put pressure on naphtha crackers in Europe and Asia, reducing their output.", "379": "This tightens propylene markets, with relative prices rising, supporting naphtha cracker economics.", "380": "However, the wave of new PDH capacity over recent years appears to have changed this.", "381": "Chinese producers alone have more than doubled global PDH capacity between 2019 and 2024.", "382": "Thanks to ample propane availability, propylene supply from these plants has been able to rise in tandem with ethane cracker ethylene output, especially in the United States.", "383": "This one two punch has substantially weakened the position of naphtha crackers and paved the way for a fall in operating rates on the scale seen in Europe since 2021.", "384": "Oil demand in North America is forecast to average 24,6 mb/d in 2024 2025, before gradually declining to 23 mb/d in 2030.", "385": "Oil consumption in the region will not regain its 2019 level of 24,9 mb/d.", "386": "Among the constituent

already seeing demand plateau near its current level of 20,4 mb/d, peaking in 2025 and ending the forecasting period at 18,9 mb/d.", "388": "Gasoline will account for the bulk of the US decline, as WFH, vehicle efficiencies and EVs combine for an average annual decrease of 3% for the fuel.", "389": "The main expansionary contribution will come from LPG/ethane.", "390": "At about 400 kb/d over the forecast horizon, or 1,9% per year, LPG/ethane posts the highest growth rate among the key products but still marks a major deceleration from the 6% pace posted in 2022 2023.", "391": "In the absence of major capacity additions, growth will largely depend on incremental improvement in steam cracker operating rates.", "392": "European oil demand, having already reached its post pandemic peak in 2022, is set to contract throughout the forecast period.", "393": "Gasoil , the continent\u2019s main fuel by far, accounting for almost half of the product mix , will be responsible for most

2024.", "399": "Annual growth of around 1% in LPG/ethane and jet/kerosene growth during 2023 2030 will be unable to counterbalance the structural decline in road fuels, and aggregate demand in 2030 of

increase by a combined 2,5 mb/d.", "998": "Refiners will need to adjust their product slates to meet the challenge of reduced consumption of road transport fuels, as electric vehicles increase their market share.", "999": "Moreover, the surge in petrochemical feedstock use , the pillar of oil consumption growth in our outlook , will largely be met by the massive ramp up of NGLs this decade.",

"Non refined fuel products are set to capture more than 75% of additional demand over the 2023 2030 period.", "1002": "This significant rise in non refinery product supplies will add pressure on

respectively.", "1050": "How refiners respond to these shifting product and regional demand challenges will depend on a multitude of factors, including access to cheap crude and natural gas, premium pricing locations, operating costs, and yield configurations.", "1051": "Arguably, a vertically integrated value chain from the upstream wellhead, through refining and onto a retail or industrial/commercial consumers, provides an insulated business model that can ignore shifts in value creation across the chain.", "1052": "However, this oversimplifies the complex nature of a returns focused business that seeks to optimise each aspect of its value creation.", "1053": "Without either a reduction in capacity, lower utilisation, or a material change in yields , a refinery facing contracting domestic demand is increasingly exposed to international competition.", "1054": "This shifts a greater share of production from inland CIF based pricing within the integrated value chain into the inherently weaker FOB based pricing mechanism as products are exported.", "1055": "Data for mature markets such as Japan indicate that weaker demand initially results in utilisation rates dropping, but ultimately forces capacity to be closed.", "1056": "Falling demand also subjects refined product markets to greater exposure to international trade, as demand and refined products output can become misaligned.", "1057": "Consequently, the above factors point towards an environment where closures are more likely in the Atlantic Basin.", "1058": "Considering the scale and complexity of regional refining industries, Europe stands out as having older, relatively small, and less complex refineries that are more open to international trade than other regions.", "1059": "Conversely, utilisation rates East of Suez remain steady as positive regional demand growth offers some protection from the impact of the energy transition.", "1060": "Furthermore, cost advantaged locations, access to low cost crude and proximity to structurally short markets in Asia all play a part.", "1061": "One lens through which to view refinery profitability is the relative tightness between crude and product markets.", "1062": "If refiners face a disparity in conditions between crude and product markets, then arguably they have three options for handling the mismatch.", "1063": "First, if the margin structure supports it, they can continue to pay up for crude.", "1064": "Second, if they have operational flexibility, refiners can draw crude inventories, which effectively contributes to tighter crude market conditions.", "1065": "Lastly, if margins don\u2019t support processing crude, they can cut runs and thereby transmit weakness in product markets back to crude markets.", "1066": "Tightness in both crude and product markets results in outsized returns for refineries as backwardated market structure in crude amplifies the backwardated market structure in product markets and results in extremely strong cracks for products of net importers, for example European diesel cracks.", "1067": "Conversely, weaker crude and product market conditions, as witnessed in 2020 2021 implies a tougher operating environment for refineries.", "1068": "Two caveats to this assessment are worth highlighting.", "1069": "First, the refining industry doesn\u2019t have to process crude where margins don\u2019t support it.", "1070": "The demand collapse of 2020 demonstrated the power of enforcing economic run cuts to restore profitability at refineries.", "1071": "Lessons learnt from this episode have likely not been forgotten.", "1072": "Run cuts effectively transfer product market weakness back into crude markets.", "1073": "Second, the refining industry now has a greater share of merchant refineries that can respond more quickly and be operationally and financially disciplined in reacting to changes in market conditions.", "1074": "The prospect of refined product demand contracting over the balance of the decade, initially for gasoline, and subsequently for diesel, will require adjustments to activity levels and refinery yield structures that will be signalled by individual product cracks.", "1075": "Some refineries will be forced to cut runs, either proactively or reactively, or, in the longer run, exit the industry.", "1076": "Within our assessments for the period through to 2030 we do not explicitly forecast capacity closures beyond those already announced.", "1077": "However, refinery operating rates are adjusted to reflect the heightened competitive pressures.", "1078": "We envisage that European and North American refining capacity will suffer the sharpest decline in rates, given the speed of the demand contraction is greatest there.", "1079": "Furthermore, a particularly dramatic shift could occur to US Gulf Coast  refineries.", "1080": "The period to 2030 will see the rerouting of Canadian barrels to the Pacific market via the TMX pipeline, and declining Mexican exports of Maya crude.", "1081": "Both these factors will tighten regional crude markets and likely pressure profits and operating rates.", "1082": "This report\u2019s analysis through to 2030 envisions a global refining industry that faces the challenge of meeting strong kerosene and diesel demand growth, while gasoline use drops, even though increasing naphtha demand offers a partial offset.", "1083": "We assume that refineries will adapt to the shifting demand patterns by raising middle distillate yields at the expense of naphtha and gasoline.", "1084": "Gasoline yields will need to shrink globally by 1,3% to contain potential surplus supplies.", "1085": "Notable changes that drive this are in the US refining system, given the typical draw on the middle distillate pool to feed upgrading units, such as catalytic cracking.", "1086": "Elsewhere, a partial offset comes from higher naphtha yields.", "1087": "The Covid 19 demand collapse and subsequent recovery demonstrated that national refining systems can adjust kerosene and diesel production when required by as much as two percentage points.", "1088": "In aggregate the changes required to middle distillate yields to adapt to the 2030 demand mix are neither as dramatic nor as rapid.", "1089": "The second challenge that refineries face is the continued surge in US LTO and NGL production.", "1090": "Rising supplies of light sweet crude to global markets and the concurrent OPEC+ production policy which restricts the availability of medium and heavy crude have compressed light sweet grades price premiums versus heavy sour crude differentials.", "1091": "Prior to the US shale revolution boosting supply of light sweet crude oil, the marginal barrel available to refineries was typically heavier and sourer than the average.", "1092": "This dynamic gave complex refineries a competitive advantage over less sophisticated refining capacity.", "1093": "US shale oil has inverted this trend and thereby improved the competitiveness of less sophisticated plants that would otherwise be disadvantaged by the lack of upgrading and hydrotreating capacity versus more complex ones.", "1094": "While LTO supplies have been a boon to less complex refineries, complex refineries have had to compete harder for heavy crude supplies and feedstocks to fill upgrading capacity.", "1095": "The analysis contained in this report assumes the current OPEC+ output agreement, including formal, voluntary and additional voluntary cuts, remains in place.", "1096": "Consequently, the global sour crude market is tight in the short term, but becomes increasingly long in the second half of the decade.", "1097": "We assume the majority of the global surplus will result in a product overhang dominated by gasoline components.", "1098": "Crude balances account for about one third of the surplus, but the need to meet diesel and, more particularly, kerosene demand will drive crude runs higher until late in the decade.", "1099": "In contrast to the mixed impact on refining from higher shale oil supplies, the surge in NGL production and exports from North America has, on balance, increased competition in the petrochemical feedstock markets and been a drag on refineries.", "1100": "Increased integration with petrochemical capacity has long been a preferred way to boost refinery gross margins and absorb unwanted light ends production into higher value product streams.", "1101": "The expansion of ethane and propane based petrochemical capacity has marginalised the use of naphtha and mixed feed crackers in Europe and undermined the profitability of refinery produced propylene.", "1102": "Further increases in NGL production will continue to win market share in petrochemicals and limit refineries\u2019 ability to shift away from gasoline production to increased yields of propane and propylene from their catalytic cracking operations.", "1103": "Furthermore, in tandem with higher NGL supply, mandated increases in both biofuel and renewable fuels use will also dampen the call on refined products.", "1104": "We expect to see gains in competing supplies of kerosene from sustainable aviation fuels , as well as from biodiesel and ethanol.", "1105": "On balance, the combination of new refinery start ups, predominantly in Asia, demand in the Atlantic Basin falling and increased competition from NGLs, biofuels and renewables raises the risks of further capacity closures.", "1106": "We model falling utilisation rates in OECD Europe and Americas as a proxy for this dynamic.", "1107": "However, the eventual losers in the competitive process will be determined by the trade off between being in a cost advantaged area, for example the US Gulf Coast, versus being located in a region that remains a net importer for large swathes of its fuel needs, for example Europe.", "1108": "The balance between these two factors is complicated by the recent imposition of import embargoes and trade sanctions on Russia by the European Union and the Group of Seven  that have dramatically redrawn oil trade flows and forced European markets to reprice diesel and jet fuel, such that they can attract more volumes from longer haul locations East of Suez.", "1109": "Over the 2024 to 2030 timeframe, the global refining sector is poised for a period of subdued growth, with nameplate capacity  forecast to rise from 104,2 mb/d to 107,4 mb/d.", "1110": "Installed capacity remains more than adequate to meet world demand for refined products of 85,8 mb/d by the end of the forecast period.", "1111": "While capacity increases by a net 3,3 mb/d by 2030, refinery runs are forecast to rise by only 2,1 mb/d and growth in demand for refined products  by 1,2 mb/d.", "1112": "As demand growth tapers off, global utilisation rates are expected to drop, prompting a rationalisation of capacity.", "1113": "The 3,3 mb/d in net capacity additions over the seven year period is less than the Oil 2023 forecast of 4,4 mb/d for the 2023 2028 period.", "1114": "This total includes 5,1 mb/d in new projects, offset by 1,8 mb/d in announced closures.",

the historical average, with more closures likely to be announced in the coming years.", "1117": "For now, 2025 is the peak year for refinery closures, with a total of 800 kb/d of capacity set to go offline.", "1118": "OECD Europe will bear the brunt of this reduction, with four separate closures amounting to 480 kb/d.", "1119": "In the Americas, the United States will see two shutdowns totalling 380 kb/d.", "1120": "Unexpectedly, for regions East of Suez, China will account for nearly 65% of the announced closures, as governmental restrictions on import and export quotas, and regulations on emissions continue to force independent refiners to shut down.", "1121": "Still, these closures, totalling 640 kb/d of capacity, are overshadowed by 1,6 mb/d of new refinery capacity under development.", "1122": "This slowdown in investment in refining capacity is attributed to several factors, including anticipated slower growth in demand, regulations driving the transition away from fossil fuelled vehicles  and hesitancy among refiners to further expand due to environmental, social and governance  policy pressures.", "1123": "Investment priorities for refineries have broadened from a focus on volumetric and complexity enhancements to encompass reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions , flexibility to co process low carbon feedstocks and renewable fuel production.", "1124": "Additionally, profitability is constrained by escalating carbon taxes, rising biofuel supply, fuel efficiency regulations and surging EV sales that are all eroding demand for refined transport fuels.", "1125": "Furthermore, uncertainties surrounding the macroeconomic climate and geopolitical tensions, including the Russia Ukraine conflict, are set against recent record level refinery margins, leaving many refiners holding back investment.", "1126": "The post pandemic years saw a surge in capacity as projects that were delayed by restrictions and supply chain bottlenecks were completed.", "1127": "Projects due onstream from 2024 to 2026 account for around 4,4 mb/d, accounting for most of the 5,1 mb/d of gross additions over the forecast period.", "1128": "Beyond 2026, expected completions are relatively sparse.", "1129": "Against a backdrop of slowing global demand and rising NGL, biofuel and renewable fuel supplies, the next three years may be the last period of net capacity additions.", "1130": "Subsequently, closures, although not explicitly forecast in this report, may well eclipse additions as demand growth for refined products turn negative near the end of the decade.", "1131": "The regional distribution of net capacity additions remains consistent with previous editions of this report.", "1132": "East of Suez continues to drive capacity growth, accounting for nearly 85% of the increase.", "1133": "New projects in the region will add a net 2,8 mb/d, primarily dominated by developments China, India and the Middle East.", "1134": "China and India will each add around 1 mb/d in capacity while the Middle East will expand by 630 kb/d. In the Atlantic Basin, new refineries in Nigeria  and Mexico  add a combined 1 mb/d.", "1135": "Shutdowns in OECD regions will partly offset these gains, however, resulting in a net increase of around 500 kb/d.", "1136": "The crude and condensate surplus in the Atlantic Basin grows by 2,7 mb/d, while the deficit in East of Suez expands by 2,8 mb/d, implying increasing crude flows east.", "1137": "Beyond announced closures, we expect capacity that is at risk of closure  to increase over the course of the decade, as regional utilisation rates drop in the Atlantic Basin.", "1138": "The 2023 global baseline assessment of 8,5 mb/d is inflated by poor utilisation rates in several countries, most notably Mexico, Venezuela, Russia and China, that boost the assessment by nearly 4 mb/d.",

between 1 1,5 mb/d of at risk capacity.", "1141": "By contrast, some regions will experience a reduction in spare capacity, notably in China, where improved utilisation rates for refining have been a government objective for several years.", "1142": "Smaller reductions in Africa and Russia come from increased refinery utilisation.", "1143": "Asia\u2019s growing structural shortfall in crude, in tandem with the Atlantic Basin\u2019s growing surplus, will dictate trade patterns through the end of the decade.", "1144": "The exclusion of Russian crude from most Atlantic Basin importers due to sanctions will also support increased flows of crude to the East of Suez.", "1145": "Furthermore, reduced Middle East sour crude exports are partially offset by rising Brazilian and Guyanese oil supplies.", "1146": "US LTO production will boost the supply of light sweet grades to Europe, West Africa as well as to Asia, where Atlantic Basin crude\u2019s market share increases.", "1147": "The global crude balance shifts from a deficit in 2024 to a surplus, by 2030 of 700 kb/d, driven by rising supply and slowing demand growth.", "1148": "Availability of crude surpasses the global import requirements, leading to an opportunity to rebuild global inventories.", "1149": "Within the framework of the 2023 2030 outlook, increased capacity of 3,3 mb/d and higher crude runs of 2,1 mb/d both far outweigh the growth in demand for refined products of only 1,3 mb/d.", "1150": "Refining activity in the Atlantic Basin will see utilisation rates drop by 2%, centred mostly in Europe and the Unites States where throughput falls in line with the decline in demand.", "1151": "As a result, output in the region will decrease by 600 kb/d.", "1152": "Conversely, refinery runs East of Suez will grow by 2,7 mb/d, and throughput will continue expanding unabated despite peak oil demand on the horizon.", "1153": "The Middle East, India, China and Africa are set to lead crude throughput growth over the forecast period.", "1154": "By 2030, the Atlantic Basin surplus in crude and condensates is expected to reach 7,9 mb/d, representing an increase of 2,7 mb/d from 2023.", "1155": "This surplus

significant challenges in the coming years.", "1157": "Despite the recent strength in refining margins, adverse demand trends and diminishing nearby export markets will pressure utilisation rates.", "1158": "This will likely prompt further rationalisation and restructuring to maintain the industry\u2019s competitiveness.", "1159": "Refinery runs are projected to decline by close to 1 mb/d by 2030, partly due to announced refinery closures totalling nearly 400 kb/d, but primarily because utilisation rates will need to decrease further to align with a 1,4 mb/d decline in US oil products demand.", "1160": "In California, Phillips 66 ceased processing crude at its 128 kb/d Rodeo facility and has converted the plant to a biofuel facility.", "1161": "Meanwhile, Houston's Lyondell

liquefied petroleum gas  and ethane is forecast to grow by 400 kb/d to 3 mb/d.", "1165": "NGLs supply rises by 900 kb/d, led by the Permian, while domestic demand for ethane and LPG will be less than half of this, resulting in a rising surplus available for the export market.", "1166": "The persistent deficit in the rest of the Americas will likely absorb close to 40% of the US LPG surplus, with the remainder exported to the rest of the world.", "1167": "However, the United States will face competition from the Middle East for market share East of Suez.", "1168": "The global market for light ends and LPG is projected to have an overall surplus and, akin to a game of musical chairs, someone will inevitably be left with excess product.", "1169": "In Canada, the expansion of the TMX pipeline

operations in early May, with reports of a first shipment to China enroute.", "1171": "While a sizeable portion of this will serve refineries on the US West Coast, the potential exists for a substantial portion of the crude to reach Asia, particularly China, which has the capacity to refine substantial quantities of extra heavy crude and bitumen.", "1172": "This shift in trade patterns is also expected to reshape the global shipping industry, as Canadian crude will increasingly compete with heavy crude from other countries, particularly those in Latin America and the Middle East.",

Mayan crude to the USGC, as these volumes will be refined domestically.", "1188": "The combined impact of these factors will be to reduce heavy sour crude exports from 1,1 mb/d in 2023 to potentially just 130 kb/d by 2030.", "1189": "In Latin America, refinery capacity will increase by 130 kb/d, driven solely by Brazil, closely aligning with the region's demand growth of around 100 kb/d.", "1190":
